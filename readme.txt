== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=How do I embed my BIGVU video=
Go to your video on BIGVU, if you are on the app, choose "share" and copy the link at the top of the screen. Paste it in your BIGVU Embed widget.
If you are on the web, find your video, press on the three dots to open the video's options, and choose "embed video", copy the link and paste it in your BIGVU Embed widget.

=Is BIGVU free=
You can use BIGVU for free, but you will have a BIGVU watermark on your videos. Also, you can't upload videos to the BIGVU cloud, which also means you cannot embed them.
In short, BIGVU can be used for free, but in order to use BIGVU Embed for Wordpress, you need to have a subscription.
